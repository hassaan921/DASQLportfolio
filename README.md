## Context
I solved this murder mystery as part of my portfolio project for atomcamp Data Analytics Bootcamp.

### Scenario:
I was a crime analyst in a local police department. An officer gave me a [crime scene report](crime_scene_report.csv), but I accidently lost it. The only piece of information my mind retained was it was about a **murder** that probably happened on **9th March 2023** in **Atom-city**. 

### How Can You Explore my Solution to the Mystery?
1. In the repository, you will find all the data sets as well as a schema diagram that guides about primary and foreign keys.
2. To look at the SQL queries used to solve the mystery, look for **solved mystery_sql_portfolio project**

### My Steps:
1. Uploaded all files
2. Used primary keys and composite keys to ensure data integrity
3. Explored and pre-processed the various data files
4. Using a given schema diagram, I used **inner joins** to find clues that led me to the murderer, as well as the employer of the hired gun.

### Final Thoughts
I love **mystery genre** and see lots of movies/tv series (_my favorites are Shutter Island and The OA._ Therefore, it was natural that I **loved the activity-based learning approach.**
